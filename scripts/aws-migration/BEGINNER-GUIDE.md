## Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Copy and paste this into `.env.local`, replacing with your values:

# These are NEW - replace with your values from Step 4 of Cognito
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=paste-your-client-id-here
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=paste-your-client-secret-here
COGNITO_ISSUER=https://cognito-idp.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/paste-your-user-pool-id-here

# These we'll set up later

```

## Step 4: Test Your Changes
