# Aurora Cluster Endpoint Check

## Current Configuration
Your current endpoints in `.env`:
- **Primary**: `k-fashion-aurora-cluster-instance-1.cf462wy64uko.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **Replica**: `k-fashion-aurora-cluster-instance-1-us-east-2b.cf462wy64uko.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com`

## How to Find Correct Endpoints

### 1. Via AWS Console
1. Go to **AWS RDS Console**
2. Click on **Databases**
3. Find your cluster `k-fashion-aurora-cluster`
4. Click on the cluster name
5. In **Connectivity & security** tab, you'll see:
   - **Writer endpoint** (use for DATABASE_URL_PRIMARY)
   - **Reader endpoint** (use for DATABASE_URL_REPLICA)

### 2. Check Cluster Status
Look for these statuses:
- ‚úÖ **Available** - Cluster is running
- üü° **Starting** - Cluster is waking up
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Stopped** - Cluster needs to be started
- üî¥ **Failed** - There's an issue

### 3. Expected Endpoint Format
Aurora endpoints typically look like:
- **Writer**: `k-fashion-aurora-cluster.cluster-xxxxx.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **Reader**: `k-fashion-aurora-cluster.cluster-ro-xxxxx.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com`

## Next Steps
1. Check the actual endpoints in AWS Console
2. Update your `.env` file with correct endpoints if they're different
3. Restart the cluster if it's stopped
4. Test connection again

## Alternative: Use Cluster Endpoints Instead of Instance Endpoints
Consider using cluster endpoints instead of instance endpoints:
- Cluster endpoints automatically handle failover
- Instance endpoints point to specific instances which might be down

The cluster endpoints would look like:
```
DATABASE_URL_PRIMARY="mysql://kfashion_admin:password@k-fashion-aurora-cluster.cluster-xxxxx.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/kfashion"
DATABASE_URL_REPLICA="mysql://kfashion_admin:password@k-fashion-aurora-cluster.cluster-ro-xxxxx.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/kfashion"
```
