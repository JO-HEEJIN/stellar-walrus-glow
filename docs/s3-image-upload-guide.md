### ðŸ§ª Frontend Testing
**Test Page Available:** `/test-upload`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA2LD6VIHT55OJIHVD
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[REDACTED]
S3_BUCKET=k-fashion-products-711082721767
```

### S3 Bucket Structure
```
k-fashion-products-711082721767/
â”œâ”€â”€ products/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ thumbnail/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [productId]/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [timestamp]-[filename]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gallery/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [productId]/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [timestamp]-[filename]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ detail/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [productId]/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ [timestamp]-[filename]
â”œâ”€â”€ brands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logo/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [brandId]/
â””â”€â”€ test/
    â””â”€â”€ [test-files]
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Image Upload Component
```tsx
import { ImageUpload } from '@/components/upload/image-upload'

<ImageUpload
  onUploadComplete={(url, file) => {
    console.log('Uploaded:', url)
    setProductImages(prev => [...prev, url])
  }}
  maxFiles={5}
  imageType="gallery"
  productId="prod-123"
/>
```

### 2. Product Form with Images
```tsx
import { ProductFormWithImages } from '@/components/products/product-form-with-images'

<ProductFormWithImages
  onSubmit={async (data) => {
    // data includes: thumbnailImage, images[], and all product fields
    await saveProduct(data)
  }}
  isEditing={false}
/>
```

### 3. API Upload (cURL example)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=your-jwt-token" \
  -F "file=@image.jpg" \
  -F "productId=prod-123" \
  -F "imageType=gallery"
```

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation required
- Role-based access (BRAND_ADMIN, MASTER_ADMIN only)
- User context tracking in metadata

### 2. File Validation
- File type whitelist (images only)
- Size limits (5MB max per file)
- Korean character sanitization in filenames
- Malicious file detection

### 3. S3 Security
- Private bucket with controlled access
- Presigned URLs for temporary access
- Metadata tracking (uploader, timestamp, product ID)
- Organized folder structure for access control

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Performance
- **From Seoul to Ohio S3**: ~200-500ms upload time for small images
- **File Processing**: Client-side validation reduces server load
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback prevents user frustration

### Storage Optimization
- **File Naming**: Timestamp + random string prevents conflicts
- **Folder Structure**: Organized by product/brand for easy management
- **Cleanup**: API endpoints available for file deletion

## Next Steps

### 1. Production Enhancements
- [ ] Add image compression/resizing
- [ ] Implement CDN for faster delivery
- [ ] Add batch upload functionality
- [ ] Create admin interface for S3 management

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add image cropping tools
- [ ] Implement drag-to-reorder for gallery images
- [ ] Add image filters and effects
- [ ] Create image gallery viewer component

### 3. Integration Tasks
- [ ] Connect upload to product management pages
- [ ] Add image upload to brand logos
- [ ] Implement order-related image uploads
- [ ] Create image backup and migration tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Resolved credential object is not valid"**
   - Check AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in .env
   - Ensure credentials have S3 permissions
   - Verify AWS_REGION matches bucket region

2. **Upload fails with 403 Forbidden**
   - Check S3 bucket permissions
   - Verify IAM user has PutObject permissions
   - Ensure bucket exists and is accessible

3. **File too large error**
   - Default limit is 5MB per file
   - Adjust MAX_FILE_SIZE in upload API
   - Consider client-side compression

4. **Korean filename issues**
   - Filenames are automatically sanitized
   - Non-ASCII characters are removed/replaced
   - Original filename preserved in metadata

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test S3 connection
npx tsx scripts/simple-s3-test.ts

# Test Aurora integration
npx tsx scripts/test-aurora-apis.ts

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test upload page
open http://localhost:3000/test-upload
```
