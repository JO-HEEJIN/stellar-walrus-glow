**제목:** URGENT: Cannot Login to Complete Required Security Measures - Account at Risk of Termination

---

Dear AWS Security Team,

I am writing regarding the security notice I received about unauthorized access to my AWS account. I am unable to complete the required security measures because I cannot log into my account.

**Account Information:**
- Account Email: [귀하의 AWS 계정 이메일]
- Account ID (if known): [계정 ID - 알고 있다면]
- Account Owner Name: [계정 소유자 이름]

**Critical Issue:**
I received your security notice requiring me to complete security measures by September 3, 2025, to prevent account suspension. However:

1. I cannot log into my AWS account despite changing my password
2. The account appears to be already restricted or suspended
3. I cannot access CloudTrail, EC2, Lambda, or IAM to check for unauthorized resources
4. I cannot enable MFA without account access

**Actions Already Taken:**
- ✓ Changed root account password through password reset
- ✓ Changed email account password for security
- ✓ Attempted to call AWS Support (unable to connect)
- ✓ Created support case (but cannot access it due to login issues)

**Verification Information:**
I can provide the following to verify my identity:
- Credit card last 4 digits: [등록된 카드 마지막 4자리]
- Approximate last billing amount: $[최근 청구 금액]
- Account creation date: [계정 생성 시기]
- Primary services used: [주로 사용한 서비스 - RDS, EC2 등]
- Billing address: [청구 주소]

**Urgent Request:**
1. Please provide temporary account access so I can complete the required security steps
2. Or guide me through an alternative process to secure the account without login access
3. I need to prevent the account termination scheduled for September 18, 2025

**I am available 24/7 for:**
- Phone verification: [전화번호]
- Video call verification
- Any additional identity verification required

This is extremely urgent as my production services are hosted on AWS and I cannot afford to lose access to them. Please respond immediately with instructions on how to proceed.

I understand the security concerns and am fully committed to securing my account. I just need the opportunity to do so.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[귀하의 이름]
