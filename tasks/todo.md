### Load-Balanced Architecture Implementation ⏳
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Objective**: Implement a scalable, load-balanced architecture for the K-Fashion platform

**Current State Analysis**:
- Database: Still using localhost MySQL (needs AWS Aurora with read replicas)
- Caching: No caching layer (Upstash Redis configured but not implemented)
- API Design: Some endpoints not optimized for concurrent access (especially inventory)
- File Storage: S3 bucket configured but not fully integrated

**Implementation Plan**:

#### Phase 1: Commit Current Changes
- [ ] Review and commit all pending changes
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass before committing

#### Phase 2: Database Load Balancing
- [ ] Configure AWS Aurora MySQL with:
  - [ ] Primary write instance
  - [ ] 2+ read replicas for query distribution
  - [ ] Connection pooling (pgBouncer or Aurora's built-in)
  - [ ] Automatic failover configuration
- [ ] Update Prisma configuration:
  - [ ] Set up connection pool size based on expected load
  - [ ] Configure connection timeout and retry logic
  - [ ] Implement read/write splitting at ORM level
- [ ] Create database indexes for high-traffic queries:
  - [ ] Product search queries
  - [ ] Order filtering by status/user
  - [ ] Brand product listings

#### Phase 3: Caching Layer for Load Reduction
- [ ] Implement Redis caching with Upstash:
  - [ ] Cache product listings (TTL: 5 minutes)
  - [ ] Cache brand information (TTL: 30 minutes)
  - [ ] Cache user sessions (TTL: 1 hour)
  - [ ] Implement cache warming for popular products
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategy:
  - [ ] On product updates
  - [ ] On inventory changes
  - [ ] On order status changes

#### Phase 4: API Optimization
- [ ] Implement request queuing for inventory updates:
  - [ ] Use Redis-based queue for atomic operations
  - [ ] Prevent race conditions on concurrent orders
  - [ ] Add optimistic locking for inventory
- [ ] Add pagination to all list endpoints:
  - [ ] Limit default page size to 50 items
  - [ ] Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize database queries:
  - [ ] Use select specific fields instead of full objects
  - [ ] Implement query batching where possible
  - [ ] Add database query monitoring

#### Phase 5: Static Asset Optimization
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets:
  - [ ] Use Vercel Edge Network
  - [ ] Set proper cache headers
  - [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
- [ ] Add progressive image loading

#### Phase 6: Monitoring & Auto-scaling
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch metrics:
  - [ ] Database connection pool usage
  - [ ] API response times
  - [ ] Cache hit/miss ratios
  - [ ] Error rates by endpoint
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling policies:
  - [ ] Scale read replicas based on CPU
  - [ ] Alert on high connection counts
  - [ ] Monitor query performance

**Load Testing Targets**:
- Support 1000 concurrent users
- Handle 100 orders per minute
- Maintain <200ms response time for product listings
- Achieve 90% cache hit rate for popular products
